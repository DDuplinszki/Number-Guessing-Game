				<p>In this game you have to guess a number between 0-100 (inclusive).</p>
				<p>This is a learning project, I'll try to convert it to ReactJS.
					It'll give a nice comparison and insight about ReactJS inner workings and intricacies.</p>
				<p>Plenty of more features are planned for this simple app. Dark mode, modal menus
					for start, replay and a coin flip script to decide who's the first to guess.
					Unfortunately, now you have to refresh the page to start a new game.</p>
				<p>Responsive design is yet to come, only designed for standard 1920x1080. May work on some smaller screens like 1600 or 1368 without major flaws.
				<p>The pictures are randomly generated each time a new game starts.</p>
